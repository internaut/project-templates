# A collection of software project templates

This is going to be collection of small project templates for several platforms. They allow for quick testing of ideas or as a kick starter for smaller projects.

The main motivation behind this is that you often only want to check a specific algorithm or function and at the end you - for example - spend more time setting up the camera of a mobile device than trying out the parameters of a certain image processing function.

## Collection status

I will try to add more project templates as I try out devices and platforms. For now, there is of course only a handful of templates in this repository.

See the respective platform directories for a list of the available templates.
